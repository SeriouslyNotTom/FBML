"Funword" Bluescreen My Laptop

<h1>What the heck is this?</h1>
<h3>FBML is a program that runs on your computer and listens on UDP port 42069 for the string message "ENDMYLIFEPLEASE" and once it receives that it... well... bluescreens your computer</h3>
<h1>Why though?</h1>
<h3>it's... funny?, i originally was going to make this a google home/ alexa action but that is hard for people to implement them selves, me and my friend even made a commercial for it : https://youtu.be/C2y2sOzoQRs</h3>
<br>
<h2>Also if i haven't said this explicitly yet, this will ACTUALLY bluescreen your computer, which probably is not good for it</h2>
<br>
<h1>How to build</h1>
<h3>First of all, why? and second this only builds on windows since obviously bluescreens only exist on windows.</h3>
<h2>to actually build it just run:</h2>

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```
